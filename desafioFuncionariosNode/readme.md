**Desafio Mulher Chinesa com Menor Sal√°rio**

This code uses the Axios library to make an HTTP request to a specific URL. Once the data is successfully returned in the response, the code filters and reduces through the data to obtain the woman who is Chinese and has the lowest salary. 


The code is divided into two parts: the initial code logics the task as a challenge and solved it in multiple steps whereas the second part is refactored to improve the logic and reduce the size of the code. \n\nThe final code includes a function that filters all employees from a particular country - in this case, China, then filters out women and finally reduces the employee list by salary to obtain the user's desired employee.
